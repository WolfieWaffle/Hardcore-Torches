1.7.10 Replacement for Unlit Torches

This mod adds a torch that will burn out over time. It also adds a torch that lasts twice as long, availible if you have a mod like Railcraft that adds coal coke.

The mod is mostly unfinished at the moment, but I plan to add more features in the future.

Please report bugs and suggestions to the bug tracker.
